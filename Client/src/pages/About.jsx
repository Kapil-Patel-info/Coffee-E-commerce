        <h1 className="about-heading">Our Story</h1>
        <p className="about-subheading">
          BrewCrafted was built for those who believe coffee is more than a drink — it's an experience.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text">
          What began as a tiny roasting setup in a garage quickly evolved into a growing coffee movement.
          We were frustrated by bland brews, soulless chains, and a lack of connection between coffee and community.
          Our founder, Kapil Patel, traveled across continents in search of flavor, character, and craft.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text">
          From the terraced farms of Chikmagalur to volcanic soil in Guatemala, every encounter inspired us to rethink what coffee could be.
          We wanted to give people more than caffeine — we wanted to give them a moment of stillness, of inspiration.
        </p>

        <h2 className="about-section-title">Our Mission</h2>
        <p className="about-text">
          To create a space — digital and physical — where coffee lovers can come together over exceptional quality and honest intention.
          We don’t just brew coffee. We brew trust, beauty, and connection.
        </p>

        <h2 className="about-section-title">Our Craft</h2>
        <p className="about-text">
          Every batch is hand-roasted with precision. We source only specialty-grade beans, roast them in small batches, and test obsessively to maintain flavor consistency.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          Our brewing standards are guided by the SCA (Specialty Coffee Association), and our team includes certified Q-graders, baristas, and designers obsessed with quality.
        </p>

        <h2 className="about-section-title">What We Value</h2>
        <ul className="about-list">
          <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Compostable packaging, direct-trade beans, and reduced-waste brewing.</li>
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Full traceability from farm to cup. We share who grows your coffee and how it's processed.</li>
          <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We experiment with fermentation techniques, slow-drip technologies, and design-focused café models.</li>
          <li><strong>People First:</strong> We invest in barista training, fair wages, mental wellness, and creating inclusive coffee spaces.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="about-section-title">How We Think About You</h2>
        <p className="about-text">
          You're not just a customer. You're part of a growing tribe of mindful, curious, conscious consumers.
          We design every step of our journey — from the user interface to the unboxing of your brew kit — with you in mind.

        <h2 className="about-section-title">Coffee & Culture</h2>
        <p className="about-text">
          Coffee has always been more than a beverage — it's a cultural force.
          At BrewCrafted, we celebrate stories from around the world. From Turkish coffee rituals to Scandinavian fika, we explore and share how coffee brings people together.
        </p>

        <p className="about-text">
          We host live brewing sessions, art and music events, workshops, and collaborations that fuse coffee with creativity.
        </p>

        <h2 className="about-section-title">Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p className="about-text">
          Our vision is global. We're preparing to launch flagship cafés in Mumbai and Bangalore, expand our cold brew lineup, and bring new origin coffees to India every season.
          But no matter how far we go, we'll stay grounded in our values — simplicity, quality, and connection.
